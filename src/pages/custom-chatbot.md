## **How To Create A Chatbot**

### **Step 1: Create Your Vector Database**

1. Navigate to the [Create Storage](https://idreamofai.com/create-storage) page.
2. Here, you can create your own vector database, which will be used to store the data for your chatbot.
3. Fill in the required information and create your database.

### **Step 2: Populate Your URL Queue**

1. After your database is set up, you can begin populating your URL queue.
2. Enter a list of URLs in the provided form on the same page. These URLs should lead to the pages containing the data you wish to incorporate into your chatbot.
3. Our system will verify the URLs and any valid links found on these pages will be added to your URL queue.

### **Step 3: Scrape Your Data**

1. Go to the [Crawl Request](https://idreamofai.com/crawl-request) page.
2. On this page, select the database you created from the dropdown menu.
3. Specify the page limit for your scraping request (up to 50 pages).
4. Submit the form. The system will begin to scrape the text data from the URLs in your queue, which will then be stored in your vector database.
5. Once a URL has been scraped, it will be removed from the queue. You can run the scraper as many times as necessary to scrape all URLs in your queue.

### **Step 4: Embed and Test Your Chatbot**

1. Now that your database is populated with your data, you can use your custom chatbot. Visit the [Chat Embed](https://idreamofai.com/chat-embed) page.
2. Your chatbot will utilize GPT and the data in your vector database to generate responses. The quality of the chatbot's responses will be directly tied to the quality of the data used.
3. Test the chatbot to ensure that the data is of good quality and is providing the desired results.
4. Remember, you can add more data to your vector database at any time to enhance your chatbot's performance.

With your own data and the power of GPT, you can create a personalized chatbot that meets your unique needs and provides high-quality, relevant responses.
