## Account Information

When you first open the Account page, you'll see a heading named "Account". Underneath, you can manage your personal information.

## Your Plan

In the "Your Plan" card, you can view details about your current subscription plan. If you have a subscription, it will display the name of your plan. If you do not have a subscription yet, you can choose a plan by clicking on the "Choose your plan" link. You can also manage your subscription details by clicking on the "Customer portal" button, which will take you to Stripe, our payment processing platform.

## Monthly Usage

In the "Monthly Usage" card, you can view a chart showing the number of tokens you've used this month. Tokens represent units of computational time on our AI models. Below the chart, you can see the total number of tokens you've used this month and the total allowed tokens based on your subscription plan.

## Total Usage

In the "Total Usage" card, you can see the total number of tokens you've used since creating your account.

## OpenAI API Key

In the "OpenAI API Key" card, you can add your own OpenAI API key. Using your own OpenAI API key will remove your plan's word/token limits. If you have not added a key, a message will be displayed accordingly. You can enter your API key in the form and click on the submit button to add or update your key.

You must select at least one team to share your key with. You can also choose to share your key with other teams in your account. Any teams that are NOT sharing the key will be subject to the plan limits.
