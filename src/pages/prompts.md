## **Creating and Saving Prompts**

To create a reusable prompt:

1. In the prompt bar on the right of the chat dashboard, click + New Prompt. This will generate a new prompt button with a name like Prompt 1.
2. Click on the prompt button to show the prompt form.
3. Enter a name and description for you prompt, and the prompt content into the Prompt text field. You can use place holders to make it easy to reuse your prompt. Use {{}} to denote a variable. Ex: `Write a facebook post about {{subject}}, and use a {{tone}} tone.`. 

Later when you use your prompt, you will be able to easily and quickly replace the placeholder varaible with text.
3. Choose if  you wan to share your prompt in the public prompt vault. This is encouraged, so it is ckecked by default.
4. Click save to save your prompt.

## **Using Placeholders in Prompts**

Placeholders can be added in your prompts by wrapping the placeholder text in double curly braces `{{}}`. For instance, if you're creating a product description prompt, it can be structured as: `Introducing our latest product, the {{Product Name}}. Please write a professional product description using the information given. {{Product Info}}`.

When a prompt with placeholders is selected:

1. A modal will appear with the placeholder text and a text input field beneath each placeholder.
2. You can fill in the text input fields with the specific details for that instance.
3. The filled details will replace the placeholders in the prompt, creating a custom message.

## **Accessing and Using Saved Prompts**

To access your saved prompts:

1. In the chat input area, type `/` to bring up a list of your saved prompts.
2. Scroll or search to find the desired prompt and click on it to select it.
3. If the prompt includes placeholders, fill in the details in the modal that appears.

## **Organizing Prompts into Folders**

Prompts can also be organized into folders for ease of use:

1. Go to the 'Prompts' tab.
2. Click on the 'New Folder' button to create a new folder.
3. Drag and drop prompts into the folder or click on the 'Add to Folder' icon on a saved prompt.

# **Leveraging the Prompt System**

Our platform's prompt system is a powerful tool to boost your productivity, efficiency, and creativity. Here, we delve deeper into crafting effective prompts, utilizing placeholders, and their advantages.

## **Crafting Effective Prompts**

An effective prompt can serve as a reliable base for generating high-quality AI responses. Here are some tips:

- **Be Clear and Specific:** The more specific the prompt, the more accurately the AI can respond.

- **Context Matters:** Providing more context can help the AI generate better responses. For example, instead of "Write a blog post," consider "Write a blog post about the latest trends in AI technology."

- **Direct the AI:** If you want the AI to speak in a certain tone or style, instruct it. For instance, "Write a humorous blog post about AI technology."

## **Expanding Use of Prompts**

Prompts can be used for a wide range of applications:

- **Content Generation:** Draft prompts for blog posts, social media posts, emails, etc.

- **Customer Support:** Save responses to frequently asked questions.

- **Product Descriptions:** Write prompts for new products or variants.

- **Sales and Marketing:** Prepare persuasive pitches or promotional messages.

## **Utilizing Placeholders**

Placeholders add a layer of customization to your prompts. Here's how you can maximize their use:

- **Dynamic Content:** Use placeholders for any part of the prompt you want to customize for different uses.

- **Form Letters/Emails:** If you're drafting a form letter or email, placeholders can be used for names, addresses, specific dates, or any other variable data.

- **Product Descriptions:** Placeholders can be used for product names, features, prices, etc., making your product descriptions flexible and reusable.

## **Advantages of Using Placeholders**

Using placeholders in prompts offers numerous benefits:

- **Reusability:** They allow you to use the same prompt for different purposes, making your work more efficient.

- **Personalization:** By replacing placeholders with specific data, you can create personalized messages in no time.

- **Scalability:** They make it easier to generate a large number of customized messages quickly.

- **Consistency:** Using the same prompt ensures consistency in your communication, while placeholders let you adapt the message as needed.

For example, a prompt like `Write an intro letter about our company to {{Name}}, who will be joining our team as a {{Role}} from {{Date}}. They will be providing us with {{Product or Service Provided}} etc. etc.` can be easily adapted, ensuring consistent introductions while still allowing for personalization.
