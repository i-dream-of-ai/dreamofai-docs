## **Creating and Saving Prompts**

To create a reusable prompt:

1. In the prompt bar on the right of the chat dashboard, click + New Prompt. This will generate a new prompt button with a name like Prompt 1.
2. Click on the prompt button to show the prompt form.
3. Enter a name and description for you prompt, and the prompt content into the Prompt text field. You can use place holders to make it easy to reuse your prompt. Use {{}} to denote a variable. Ex: `{{name}} is a {{adjective}} {{noun}}`, or `Write a facebook post about {{subject}}, and use a {{tone}} tone.`. Later when you use your prompt, you will be able to easily and quickly replace the placeholder varaible with text.
3. Choose if  you wan to share your prompt in the public prompt vault. This is encouraged, so it is ckecked by default.
4. Click save to save your prompt.

## **Using Placeholders in Prompts**

Placeholders can be added in your prompts by wrapping the placeholder text in double curly braces `{{}}`. For instance, if you're creating a product description prompt, it can be structured as: `Introducing our latest product, the {{Product Name}}. Please write a professional product description using the information given. {{Product Info}}`.

When a prompt with placeholders is selected:

1. A modal will appear with the placeholder text and a text input field beneath each placeholder.
2. You can fill in the text input fields with the specific details for that instance.
3. The filled details will replace the placeholders in the prompt, creating a custom message.

## **Accessing and Using Saved Prompts**

To access your saved prompts:

1. In the chat input area, type `/` to bring up a list of your saved prompts.
2. Scroll or search to find the desired prompt and click on it to select it.
3. If the prompt includes placeholders, fill in the details in the modal that appears.

## **Organizing Prompts into Folders**

Prompts can also be organized into folders for ease of use:

1. Go to the 'Prompts' tab.
2. Click on the 'New Folder' button to create a new folder.
3. Drag and drop prompts into the folder or click on the 'Add to Folder' icon on a saved prompt.

## **Benefits of Using the Prompt System**

Using the prompt system offers numerous benefits:

- **Efficiency:** It allows you to reuse prompts, saving time on typing out repeated messages.

- **Customization:** With placeholders, you can easily tailor your prompts for different situations, items, or brands.

- **Organization:** Folders allow you to neatly categorize your prompts for easy access and use.

- **Productivity:** By reducing manual repetition, it lets you focus on more important tasks.

For example, if you are using prompts for marketing different products, a prompt like `Check out the amazing features of our {{Product Name}}` can be reused effortlessly for each product. Just replace `{{Product Name}}` with the name of the product, and you're good to go!
