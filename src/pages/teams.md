## **Using Teams in ChatGPT**


### **Understanding Teams**

1. **Team Membership:** Every user is automatically assigned to a default team upon subscribing. If invited by a team owner and they sign up using the invite link, they're added to the inviting team. 

2. **Creating Additional Teams:** Users with higher-tier plans can create more than one team. The exact number of teams a user can create depends on their plan. 

3. **Team Ownership:** The team owner is the only user who can add members to a team or delete the team. Note that a user cannot delete their last team, and a team owner cannot be removed from a team.

### **Managing Your Teams**

1. **Updating Team Information:** The team owner can update the team's name and description on the team's page. Each team has a unique page accessible via the team navigation menu in the sidebar. 

2. **Editing Teams:** To show the edit form, click on the button with the pen icon located in the team table footer. 

3. **Creating a Team:** Navigate to the teams page and click on the "+ Add Team" button. This action will display a simple form where you can enter the name and description for the new team. You can create as many teams as your plan allows.

4. **Adding Users to Teams:** A team owner can add users up to the user limit set by their plan.

### **Understanding Plan Limits and Teams**

Plan limits apply across all teams. For instance, the tokens used by Team A and Team B are summed up and applied against the plan's token limit. 

### **Team-Specific Data**

Conversations, prompts, and images are sorted by team, providing a clear and organized view of each team's activities.

### **Switching Between Teams**

A user can switch between their teams using the dropdown menu located in the User menu. You can access the User menu by clicking the user button located at the bottom of the sidebar on the left side of the page. 

### **Why Use Teams?**

1. **Organization:** Teams provide an effective way to sort and manage conversations, prompts, and images, making it easier to keep track of different projects or departments.

2. **Collaboration:** Teams enable members to work together more effectively. By grouping users who are working together on the same projects or tasks, you enhance collaboration and communication.

3. **Efficiency:** Team features can streamline workflow by ensuring that the right people have access to the right resources and information. It allows for better distribution of tasks, discussions, and decision-making processes.
