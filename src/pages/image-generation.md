## **Integrated Chat**

The integrated chat is a quick and user-friendly way to create images using DALLE-2. Here's how it works:

1. **Start a chat:** Input your request for an image. For instance, you might ask "Write a short post about the future of our cities, and include an image of a futuristic city at sunset."

2. **Get a prompt:** The AI will respond with a prompt based on your request.

3. **Generate an image:** DALLE-2 will generate an image based on the provided prompt.

This method is suitable for quick image generation, where detailed customization isn't a primary concern.

## **Generate Image Page**

For more control over the generated images, the 'Generate Image' page is the ideal choice. Here's the process:

1. **Input a prompt:** Write your desired image description in the form.

2. **Select options:** You have the freedom to choose the image size, the number of images to generate, and select between DALLE-2 or the Stable Diffusion image API.

3. **Generate your image(s):** Hit the 'Generate' button, and the system will start creating your images.

The 'Generate Image' page is excellent for creating detailed, high-quality images that require more time and processing power.

## **Choosing Between Methods**

The method you choose depends on your specific needs:

- **For quick image creation,** the integrated chat is fast and easy to use.

- **For detailed and high-quality images,** the 'Generate Image' page offers greater control over image properties.

This flexibility ensures you can get the most out of DALLE-2, whether you're brainstorming ideas or creating stunning, high-resolution images for your projects.
