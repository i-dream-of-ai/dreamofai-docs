Our folder system provides an intuitive and efficient way to organize your conversations and prompts. It consists of two sidebars - one each for conversations and prompts. This guide will walk you through each step of using the folder system, including creating folders, renaming them, sharing with your team, and using the drag-and-drop feature.

## **Creating a New Folder**

Creating a new folder is a simple, two-step process:
1. Find the "New Folder" button, located at the top of either the conversations or prompts sidebar.
2. Click this button. A new folder will promptly appear in the corresponding sidebar.

## **Renaming Folders**

To customize the name of your folder, follow these steps:
1. Look for the edit icon, typically found next to the newly created folder.
2. Click on the edit icon. A text field will appear, allowing you to rename the folder according to your preferences.

## **Automatic Folder Sharing**

Our system is designed with team collaboration in mind. Every new folder you create is automatically shared with your active team, streamlining communication and cooperation.

## **The Drag-and-Drop Feature**

One of the key features of our folder system is its drag-and-drop functionality. This allows you to easily add and remove prompts from folders:

- **Adding a prompt to a folder:** Simply click on the prompt you wish to move, drag it over the desired folder, and drop it. The prompt will move into the folder.
- **Removing a prompt from a folder:** If you wish to take a prompt out of a folder, click on it, drag it out of the folder, and drop it in the desired location.

## **The Benefits of Using Folders**

Organizing your prompts and conversations in folders offers numerous advantages:

- **Organization:** Separate different conversations and prompts into distinct folders for easy referencing and retrieval.
- **Collaboration:** Shared folders enhance team cooperation on shared topics or projects. Every team member can access these folders, which boosts communication and productivity.
- **Customization:** Rename folders to reflect their contents, improving navigation and searchability.
- **Versatility:** The drag-and-drop feature allows you to easily move prompts around, accommodating evolving project needs and preferences.
